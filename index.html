    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Mihir Patel photo">
    <p>Hi, I’m Mihir! I’m a mathematics and computer science student passionate about algorithms, 
    complexity theory, and their applications in research. I’m beginning my MSc in Mathematics 
    and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford in Fall 2025, after completing 
    my BS in Mathematics and Computer Science at Haverford College.</p>

    <h2>Research Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Project 1:</strong> Balancing node centrality in social networks — proved hardness results 
      and developed approximation algorithms. Culminated in a preprint with collaborators at the University of Utah.</li>
      <li><strong>Project 2:</strong> Investigated parameterized algorithms for the 2-edge-connected spanning subgraph 
      problem with Georgetown University’s Algorithms group.</li>
      <li><strong>Project 3:</strong> Improved selection algorithms for finding the kth order statistic 
      (Quickselect pivoting strategies) under supervision at George Washington University.</li>
    </ul>
