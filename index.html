        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an incoming MSc student in the
          <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/msc-courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science"

            Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science program at Oxford
          </a>
          (2025–2026 cohort). I earned my BS in Mathematics and Computer Science from Haverford
          College in May 2025. My research interests are in algorithms and computational complexity,
          specifically approximation algorithms, graph problems, and parameterized complexity.

          <summary><em>Improving Network Fairness With Edge Addition</em></summary>
          <p>Assuming information spreads along the edges of a social network, some nodes naturally have greater access
            to
            information simply because of their position in the network, creating inherent advantage gaps. The problem I
            studied asks whether we can add a limited number of edges to reduce these gaps (in particular, to equalize
            the
            closeness centralities of two chosen nodes). This turns out to be NP-hard, so my work focused on designing
            approximation algorithms and proving inapproximability results.</p>

          <p>This research formed my undergraduate thesis at Haverford, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr.
            Sorelle
            Friedler (CS) and Dr. Josh Sabloff (Math), and to collaborate with Dr. Blair Sullivan and the Theory
            in Practice group at the University of Utah. My
            <a href="files/math-thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Math thesis submission</a>
            is accessible to a general math audience, while the
            <a href="files/cs-thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS thesis submission</a>
            has a more extensive literature review and assumes familiarity with concepts from an undergraduate
            algorithms
            course.
