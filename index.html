        <p>
          I am an incoming MSc student in the
          <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/msc-courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science"

          (2025–2026 cohort). I earned my BS in Mathematics and Computer Science from Haverford
          College in May 2025. My research interests are in algorithms and computational complexity,
          specifically approximation algorithms, graph problems, and parameterized complexity.

        <h3>Some Theory Research Projects from My Undergraduate Studies</h3>

        <details>
          <summary><em>Improving Network Fairness With Edge Addition</em></summary>
          <p>Assuming information spreads along the edges of a social network, some nodes naturally have greater access
            to
            information simply because of their position in the network, creating inherent advantage gaps. The problem I
            studied asks whether we can add a limited number of edges to reduce these gaps (in particular, to equalize
            the
            closeness centralities of two given nodes). This turns out to be NP-hard, so my work focused on designing
            approximation algorithms and proving inapproximability results.</p>

          <p>This research formed my undergraduate thesis at Haverford, where I was fortunate to be advised by Dr.
            Sorelle
            Friedler (CS) and Dr. Josh Sabloff (Math), and to collaborate with Dr. Blair Sullivan and the Theory
            in Practice group at the University of Utah. My
            <a href="files/math-thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Math thesis submission</a>
            is accessible to a general math audience, while the
            <a href="files/cs-thesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS thesis submission</a>
            has a more extensive literature review and assumes familiarity with concepts from an undergraduate
            algorithms
            course.

          <summary><em>Improving Quickselect With Dynamic Pivot Selection</em></summary>
          <p>The Quickselect algorithm efficiently finds the kth largest element in an unsorted list, running in
            expected
            linear time. However, its performance depends heavily on selecting good “pivots” during recursion, elements
            that ideally split the list roughly in half and minimize the size of the subproblem. In this project, I
            proposed and implemented a dynamic pivot selection strategy, and compared this approach to Quickselect's
            standard method of choosing pivots at random, evaluating both on large random datasets.</p>

          <p>My method produced more balanced partitions than Quickselect in practice, while remaining far simpler and
            more implementable than the state-of-the-art Floyd-Rivest algorithm. I summarized my findings in
            <a href="https://medium.com/@mihirdpatel/improving-quickselect-with-dynamic-pivot-selection-8ddf584ded80"
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this technical article</a>, and was advised by Dr. Amrinder
            Arora
            of George Washington University.

          <summary><em>Comparing Bit and Time Efficiency of Coding Algorithms on Real World Data</em></summary>
          <p>I analyzed the performance of three data compression algorithms (fixed-length encoding, Shannon coding, and
            Huffman coding) using real-world text data. To evaluate bit efficiency, I examined how the entropy of each
            scheme changed as the number of unique characters increased. For this, I wrote a program that generated
            large
            alphabets by using hexadecimal representations, allowing me to test tens of thousands of unique characters
            instead of being limited to the hundreds of characters available in ASCII.</p>

          <p>I also evaluated time efficiency by measuring how quickly each scheme could encode and decode messages. The
            results confirmed that Huffman consistently outperformed Shannon in practice, while fixed-length encoding
            was
            less efficient overall, even in cases where our theoretical analysis suggested it might compete with Shannon
            coding.</p>

          <summary><em>A Greedy Algorithm For Registrar Scheduling</em></summary>
          <p>In this project, we designed a greedy algorithm to simulate the scheduling process a college registrar
            performs -- assigning rooms, professors, times, and students to classes without conflicts. The algorithm
            ensures correctness (e.g., no double-bookings or schedule clashes) and incorporates realistic constraints,
            such as department-specific rooms, minimizing course overlap within a major, and accommodating popular
            classes
            over Zoom. We also analyzed the algorithm's time complexity, and ran experiments to test
            how well it satisfied student preferences -- on average over 80% of students were placed into their
            preferred
            classes while handling complex scheduling constraints. Our work is summarized in
            <a href="files/registrar-problem.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this write-up</a>.
